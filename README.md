# K22-Delay
A Delay Effect Audio Plugin

Built on the JUCE framework, this VST/AU plugin allows users to add delay effects onto individual audio tracks in their preferred DAW. Allowing manipulation of taps and delay times, as well as equation-based amplitude and time manipulation, it functions as an experimental design for personal experience in audio development.

## Build Instructions
To build and use this plugin, clone/download it locally, open in Xcode, and build it from there. This automatically generates the VST, VST3, and AU builds and puts them in the correct non-native plug-in locations, from where your preferred DAW should be able to scan for it.

Note, if you would simply like the VST file itself, please email me at kmeelu.52@gmail.com.
